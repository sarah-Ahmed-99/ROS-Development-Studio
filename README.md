## steps to use ROS Development Studio:
#### 1. Create an account: Go to the ROS Development Studio website and it is already there. This will allow you to access the online development environment.

#### 2. Start a new project: After logging in, click the “New Project” button to create a new ROS project. You can choose from a variety of ROS generators or starters from scratch.

#### 3. Customize project settings: In the project settings, you can choose different options such as ROS version, workspace name, and source code location.

#### 4. Write ROS Code: The ROS Development Studio environment provides a web editor in which you can write your own ROS contracts, packages, and other related files. You can use built-in features such as symbolic name and easy syntax highlighting for help.
#### 5. Build and All: Once you've written your code, you can build it and all directly within ROS Development Studio. This ensures that your ROS code is saved correctly and ready for deployment.

#### 6. Big Little Visualization: ROS Development Studio includes a set of small little visualization tools. You can use the built-in RViz tool to visualize the state of your robot, and the modern rqt tool for your ROS systems.

#### 7. Testing and Simulation: ROS Development Studio allows you to test your ROS application in a simulated environment, such as Gazebo, without the need for physical robots.

#### 8. Deployment to Devices: After testing your ROS application in simulation, you can deploy it to your physical robot. ROS Development Studio provides options to download your own ROS workspace or connect to a remote robot.

#### 9. Collaborate with others: ROS Development Studio supports collaborative development, allowing you to invite team members to work on the same project and follow changes in real time.
